# Perceptron
* Perceptron (html & JavaScript)

## Introduction
* Single perceptron
* No activation function
* Two inputs, two train data, bias input (optional), learning rate
* Hyperplane

## Explain
* Start: generating two train data (desired output: 1 and -1) with two featrues ranging [0, 1] 
* Step: training by each train data, alternately
* Updated by w~1~(t+1) = w~1~(t) + Î·(d-y(t))x~1~(t), where y = w~1~x~1~ + w~2~x~2~ + b
