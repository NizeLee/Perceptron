# Perceptron
* Perceptron (html & JavaScript)

## Introduction
* Single perceptron
* No activation function
* Two inputs, two train data, bias input (optional), learning rate
* Hyperplane

## Explain
* Start: generating two train data (desired output: 1 and -1) with two featrues ranging [0, 1] 
* Step: training by each train data, alternately
* Updated by w<sub>1</sub>(t+1) = w<sub>1</sub>(t) + Î·(d-y(t))x<sub>1</sub>(t), where y = w<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + w<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + b
